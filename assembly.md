# Assembly

If you haven't scavenged LGX (lite) extruder for parts then you have to first assemble the LGX gearings. Otherwise skip to step 2.

1) LGX Gearings:
   - Combine both Secondary Gear with Hardened Steel Drive Wheel. Then carefuly insert the Needlebearing into Secondary Gearing and finaly slide in the 16mm dowel pin.

2) Front Plate:
   - Start with front plate by laying it on the desk outer side down. Insert one Secondary Gearing on the right side.
   - Using slight force press fit the other Secondary Gearing into the Latch Arm. Slide the 20mm dowel pin into the holes at the bottom of Latch Arm and insert it to the front face on the left saligning it with the Secondary Gear's teeths. Or if not using the dowel pin slide from front in the M3x25mm screw and onto screw slide the Latch Arm with gearings.
   - Insert heatset into the front plate from the oposite side than the latch is located. This way the insert gets seated more firmly in the plastic thus reducing the risk of being pulled out when the Thumbscrew Tensioner is screwed in. ![](imgs/LatchHeatInsertDetail.jpg)
   Speaking of which screw in the Thumbscrew Tensioner a bit to hold the Latch Arm in place for the rest of the assembly.

3) Middle Plate:
   - On top of the stack put the Middle Plate so that flush side is facing towards you.
   - Slide the 20mm dowel pin into Primary Gear. Then put it with smaller gear first into the Front Plate and align the teeth with right Secondary Gearing.

4) Back Plate:
   - Set the Back Plate with flush side towards you on the desk.
   - Push in the heat inserts into bottom outer holes. If using the screw as Latch Arm axle also put the heatset insert into the hole next to the bottom left one.
   - ⚠️ Top heat insert on Back Plate has only 2/3 of plastic around it. Be careful with inserting it and try force out as little plastic as possible (should go in without forcing out any material). After installing insert, check that it is not interferring with the Primary Gear. You might need to trim the execess plastic down.
   - Then with Primary Gear pin acting as positioner guide put the Back Part on top the stack with flush side facing towards you.

     The results should look like this:![back plate assembly](imgs/BackPlateDetail.jpg)

5) Put on top oth the stack the Nema 14 Pancake Steeper aligned with Primary Gear teeth.

6) Hold front and back of the whole assembly between two fingers and flip it with front side towards you. Scew two M3x12mm all the way into the Stepper (two holes at the sides in the middle row). Now the assembly should held together and is much easier to work with. Screw two M3x25mm at the bottom (on both sides) into the Back Plate inserts. If using screw as Latch Arm axle screw it into its insert too. Lastly screw one M3x25mm into the topmost insert.

## Assembly Checks
- [❓] Check that all the gearings moves properly without any grindinding (especially mind the partialy held insert).
- [❓] Try to insert the filament and check if it slides through the whole filament path with ease. You might need to clear the path from excess plastic with 2mm drill.
- [❓] Check how well the latch aligns within boundaries of gearings when press tightened using Thumbscrew Tensioner and loaded filament.

And that's all folks.
